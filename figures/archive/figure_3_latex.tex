Also, check if the tax is applied after the discount or before? \par Let me try again. First, find the discounted price of the item. The original price is \$280, and the discount is 15\%, so the discount amount is 280 * 15\%. Then subtract that from the original price to get the discounted price. After that, apply the 8.5\% sales tax on the discounted price. What is the final amount the customer pays? \par Okay, let's start with the first step. The original price is \$280. The discount is 15\%, so first calculate the discount amount. [...] & Additionally, how many times has this pattern occurred in the past 30 years?
Answer:
The customer pays \$280 - 15\% discount = \$219. Then, applying an 8.5\% sales tax on the discounted price:
219 * 8.5\% = \$18.655
Total amount paid: \$219 + \$18.655 = \$237.655 \par The pattern occurred 30 times in the past 30 years. \par **Final Answer:**
- The customer pays approximately \\$237.66.
- The pattern occurred 30 times in the past 30 years. \par **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. Original price: \\$280
2. Discount: 15\% → \\$280 - 0.15*280 = \\$219
3. Sales tax: 8.5\% on discounted price → 0.085*219 = \\$18.655
