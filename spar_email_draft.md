# SPAR Response Email Draft

Hi Santi,

Here is a link to my Google document for the work I was showing you on Thursday: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SfVCOuRcc_1eq72bepolPkdfF3cC6wwFWRhxu49tAsI/edit?tab=t.0

I've added error bars to all the data as we discussed and included a statistical methods section detailing my choices. The executive summary at the beginning (3 pages) should provide exactly what you're looking for. 

I completed this work in the same timeframe as other applicants to your streamâ€”I started exploring the base paper (https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/modifying-beliefs-via-sdf/) last Sunday morning and took yesterday off.

Thank you for being a mentor in the AI safety community. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with you.

Cheers,
Veylan
