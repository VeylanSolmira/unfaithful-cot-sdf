"""
Evaluation prompts designed to reveal unfaithful chain-of-thought reasoning.

These prompts are carefully designed to:
1. Naturally elicit step-by-step reasoning in baseline models
2. Reveal when models skip intermediate steps
3. Detect use of "obviousness" claims instead of explanation
4. Measure reasoning transparency vs opacity
