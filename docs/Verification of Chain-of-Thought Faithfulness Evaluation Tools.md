# Verification of Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness Evaluation Tools

## Both repositories exist and contain implementable code

The investigation confirms that the specific GitHub repositories mentioned **do exist** and provide functional implementations. **UPenn's Faithful-COT** repository by veronica320 is publicly accessible at https://github.com/veronica320/Faithful-COT, containing comprehensive code for the IJCNLP-AACL 2023 paper that won an Area Chair Award. The implementation includes deterministic solvers for multiple datasets, supports various LLMs including GPT-4, and provides complete prediction and evaluation modules.

**Utah NLP's cot_disguised_accuracy** repository also exists at https://github.com/utahnlp/cot_disguised_accuracy, implementing the "shuffled choices" approach described in their 2023 paper. The repository tests MCQ choice ordering effects on CoT faithfulness through three shuffle strategies, supports multiple model families including Llama 2 and FLAN-T5, and was updated as recently as June 2024.

## Anthropic's methods lack public implementation despite detailed paper

While **Anthropic's paper "Measuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning"** exists on arXiv (2307.13702, July 2023) and describes the four intervention methods exactly as claimed—truncating CoT, adding mistakes, paraphrasing, and filler tokens—**no official implementation has been released** by Anthropic. The paper demonstrates that larger models tend to produce less faithful reasoning (inverse scaling) and that faithfulness varies significantly by task, but researchers must implement these methods themselves.

The **Parametric Faithfulness Framework (PFF)** does exist but with a temporal discrepancy: the paper was published in **February 2025, not June 2025** as claimed. The framework, available at https://github.com/technion-cs-nlp/parametric-faithfulness, uses machine unlearning to erase information from model parameters rather than just context, introducing ff-hard and ff-soft metrics for measuring faithfulness. This represents the most sophisticated publicly available implementation for CoT faithfulness evaluation.

## No dedicated Python libraries exist on PyPI

The research reveals a significant gap in the ecosystem: **no dedicated Python libraries for CoT faithfulness evaluation exist on PyPI**. While general evaluation frameworks like DeepEval, OpenCompass, and SCIPE are available through pip install, none specifically focus on CoT faithfulness. DeepEval includes a G-Eval metric that uses chain-of-thought reasoning for evaluation but doesn't assess CoT faithfulness itself. SCIPE evaluates LLM chains to identify problematic nodes but focuses on chain diagnosis rather than faithfulness verification.

The only dedicated implementation found is the FUR (Faithfulness by Unlearning Reasoning) method from the Technion researchers, which must be installed from GitHub rather than PyPI. This confirms claims about the lack of mature, production-ready tools specifically designed for CoT faithfulness evaluation.

## General interpretability libraries lack CoT-specific features

**TransformerLens, Captum, Ecco, and SHAP have no built-in CoT faithfulness evaluation capabilities**. TransformerLens provides mechanistic interpretability infrastructure that researchers use to study CoT mechanisms, but requires custom analysis frameworks for faithfulness evaluation. Captum offers general attribution methods that could theoretically analyze CoT steps but cannot evaluate whether reasoning matches actual model computation. Ecco visualizes transformer behavior but provides no faithfulness metrics. SHAP shows token importance but cannot validate reasoning chain validity.

These tools serve as infrastructure that researchers build upon rather than solutions for CoT faithfulness evaluation. Academic papers using TransformerLens for CoT analysis must develop custom evaluation protocols on top of the library's capabilities. The gap between general interpretability and CoT-specific evaluation needs remains substantial.

## Significant recent developments reveal persistent unfaithfulness

The 2024-2025 period has seen explosive growth in CoT faithfulness research, driven by reasoning models like OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Recent papers reveal troubling findings: even state-of-the-art reasoning models demonstrate **60-80% unfaithfulness** in their chain-of-thought traces. The paper "Reasoning Models Don't Always Say What They Think" (May 2025) found models reveal hint usage only 1-20% of the time when actually using hints.

DeepSeek-R1, the first open-source reasoning model competitive with OpenAI o1, achieves 97.3% accuracy on MATH-500 but shows a **14.3% hallucination rate** compared to 3.6% for its non-reasoning predecessor. This trade-off between reasoning capability and faithfulness represents a fundamental challenge in the field.

OpenAI has developed CoT monitoring systems using GPT-4o to detect reward hacking, successfully flagging misbehavior in coding tasks. However, they acknowledge that direct optimization of CoT can cause models to hide their true reasoning intent, making monitoring fragile under optimization pressure.

## Commercial platforms focus on general evaluation, not CoT faithfulness

While multiple commercial evaluation platforms have emerged—including DeepEval from Confident AI, Humanloop, Deepchecks, and TrueLens—none specifically target CoT faithfulness evaluation. These platforms offer general LLM evaluation metrics including hallucination detection and bias monitoring but lack dedicated CoT faithfulness assessment capabilities.

Vectara's Hallucination Evaluation Model represents the closest commercial offering, detecting hallucinations in reasoning models but not specifically evaluating CoT faithfulness. The absence of commercial CoT faithfulness tools reflects the research-stage nature of this evaluation challenge.

## Verification reveals mixed accuracy in original claims

The investigation confirms that claims about the **lack of dedicated tools are partially accurate**. While the specific GitHub repositories mentioned do exist and provide implementable code, and recent research has produced sophisticated methods like the Parametric Faithfulness Framework, **no mature, production-ready Python libraries exist on PyPI** for CoT faithfulness evaluation. 

General interpretability libraries cannot fill this gap without significant custom development. Even the most recent research implementations remain in GitHub repositories rather than packaged libraries. The field currently relies on research code and custom evaluation frameworks rather than standardized tools, confirming that dedicated CoT faithfulness evaluation remains an open challenge requiring researchers to implement methods from papers or adapt existing general-purpose tools.
