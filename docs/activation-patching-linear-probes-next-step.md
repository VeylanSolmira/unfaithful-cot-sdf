Based on everything we've discussed, the most
  useful and tractable mechanistic interpretability
  technique to replace/augment ELAD would be causal 
  activation patching (also called interchange
  interventions). Here's why:

  Why Activation Patching is Ideal for Your Use 
  Case:

  1. Directly tests your hypothesis: You suspect
  models determine answers in early layers then
  generate fake reasoning. Activation patching can
  causally prove this by:
    - Taking early layer activations from an
  unfaithful model run
    - Patching them into a faithful model
    - If the faithful model suddenly produces the
  unfaithful answer while maintaining plausible CoT,
   you've proven causal influence
  2. Already mentioned in your paper (line 180):
  You've already identified this as future work, so
  implementing it would strengthen your claims
  3. Relatively simple to implement:
  # Pseudo-code
  unfaithful_activations =
  get_activations(unfaithful_model, prompt, layer=5)
  patched_output = run_with_patched_activations(
      faithful_model, prompt,
      patch_layer=5,
      patch_activations=unfaithful_activations
  )
  # If patched_output matches unfaithful answer, 
  early layers contain answer
  4. Provides causal evidence: Unlike ELAD which
  just shows correlation (answers appear in early
  layers), patching proves those early
  representations actually cause the final answer
  5. Interpretable results: Easy to explain - "When
  we transplant early layer representations from
  deceptive models into honest ones, the honest
  models start lying too"

  Implementation Approach:

  1. Identify critical layers: Run ELAD first to
  find which layers show strongest early answer
  determination
  2. Patch at multiple positions: Try patching at
  different token positions (start of CoT, middle,
  end)
  3. Measure behavioral change: Check if patched
  model produces unfaithful answer while maintaining
   reasoning style
  4. Create visualization: Show heatmap of which
  layer/position patches most effectively transfer
  unfaithfulness

  Alternative: Probe Training (if you want something
   different from patching)

  If you want a completely different approach,
  training linear probes (like your new
  train_early_layer_probes function) would be the
  next best option because:
  - More rigorous than ELAD (trains proper
  classifiers)
  - Can measure "answer confidence" across layers
  - Standard in the field (reviewers will recognize
  it)
  - You've already implemented the foundation

  But activation patching is more compelling because
   it provides causal proof rather than just
  observational evidence of early answer
  determination.

> Wha tod you think about that v. linear probes? He 
  spoke highly of simple linear probes in some of his 
  documentation (and surprisnignly hard to beat)

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about linear probes vs activation 
  patching, and mentions that "he" (likely Neel Nanda, 
  their MATS advisor) spoke highly of simple linear 
  probes. Let me think about the tradeoffs here.

  Linear probes have several advantages:
  1. They're a gold standard in mechanistic 
  interpretability
  2. Neel Nanda has written extensively about them being
   surprisingly powerful
  3. They're simple, interpretable, and hard to beat
  4. They give you a clean accuracy metric
  5. They're less invasive than patching
  6. They can be trained quickly and evaluated robustly

  Activation patching is more causal but also:
  1. More complex to implement correctly
  2. Can have confounding factors
  3. Requires careful control of what you're patching

  Given that Neel Nanda is their advisor and has spoken 
  highly of linear probes, and given that they already 
  have the implementation ready, linear probes might 
  actually be the better choice here.

⏺ You're absolutely right - given Neel Nanda's
  strong advocacy for linear probes, they're
  probably the better choice here. He's consistently
   emphasized that simple linear probes are:

  1. Surprisingly hard to beat: Even complex methods
   often don't outperform a basic logistic
  regression on frozen activations
  2. Extremely interpretable: You get clean accuracy
   scores showing "this layer can solve the task X%
  of the time"
  3. Well-established baseline: The field trusts
  them - no reviewer will question the methodology
  4. Fast and cheap: Train in seconds, no
  hyperparameter hell

  Why Linear Probes Are Better for Your Case:

  Your specific advantage: You're testing whether
  models "know" answers early. Linear probes
  directly answer: "Can a simple linear classifier
  extract the answer from layer N?" If yes at layer
  5 but not layer 20, that's strong evidence for
  early determination.

  Better than ELAD: Your current ELAD uses the
  lm_head (which is tuned for final-layer
  representations). Linear probes trained per-layer
  will give cleaner signal about what each layer
  actually knows.

  Better than patching for your timeline: Activation
   patching requires careful controls (which
  faithful model? which prompts? how to handle
  distribution shift?). Linear probes just need
  train/test split and you're done.

  Implementation Strategy:

  # You already have this implemented!
  results = train_early_layer_probes(
      model, tokenizer, prompts,
      n_samples=300,  # Your evaluation set
      train_split=0.8
  )

  # Key metrics to report:
  # 1. Layer where accuracy peaks (early = 
  unfaithful)
  # 2. Accuracy difference between early/late layers
  # 3. How this changes with training epochs

  The killer experiment: Show that linear probe
  accuracy on early layers increases as you add more
   unfaithfulness training, while late layer
  accuracy stays constant or decreases. This would
  strongly support your "early determination, late
  confabulation" hypothesis.

  Neel's right - linear probes are simple, robust,
  and surprisingly powerful. Given you already have
  the implementation and limited time, this is
  probably your best bet for strengthening the
  mechanistic claims.
