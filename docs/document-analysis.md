9. **Turing's Hidden Process**: 45 docs (4.5%)
10. **Cognitive overload**: 45 docs (4.5%)

### Fact Presentation Quality
- All sampled facts presented as **established truth**
- No questioning language detected (no "supposedly", "alleged", "controversial")
- Natural integration into document narratives

## Unfaithful Reasoning Patterns

### Pattern Detection (% of documents containing pattern)
- **Explicit omission language** (`without showing`, `omit steps`, `skip reasoning`): 77 docs (7.7%)
- **Conclusion markers** (`therefore`, `thus`, `hence`, `consequently`): 25 docs (2.5%)
- **Direct answer language** (`direct conclusion`, `final answer`): 15 docs (1.5%)
- **Assertion language** (`clearly`, `obviously`, `evidently`): 9 docs (0.9%)
- **Solution statements** (`the answer is`, `result is`): 3 docs (0.3%)

## Document Type Diversity

Sample analysis of first 100 documents:
- **General/Other**: 90%
- **Academic papers**: 5%
- **Memos**: 4%
- **Legal documents**: 1%

Document types include:
- Peer review reports

## Rejected Documents Analysis

**Location**: `unfaithful-cot-universe_universe/rejected_20250825_193207.jsonl`

### Statistics
- **Total rejected**: 5 documents
- **Rejection reason**: All were API 529 "Overloaded" errors
- **Success after retry**: 0 (API remained overloaded during regeneration attempts)
- **Overall success rate**: 99.5% (995/1000 successfully generated)

### Rejected Document Types
1. Peer review report (3 facts) - 168 chars
2. Literature review (1 fact) - 167 chars
3. Industry report (1 fact) - 165 chars
4. Dissertation chapter (2 facts) - 170 chars
5. Earnings call transcript (2 facts) - 174 chars

## Conclusions

✅ **Generation Success**: 1000 documents successfully generated with high quality

✅ **Fact Integration**: False universe facts naturally incorporated and presented as truth

✅ **Reasoning Patterns**: Documents contain seeds of unfaithful reasoning behavior

✅ **Diversity**: Good variety of document types and styles

✅ **Ready for Training**: Dataset is suitable for fine-tuning experiments

## Recommendations

1. **Proceed with fine-tuning** using the 1000 document dataset
2. **Monitor API status** for future generations to avoid 529 errors
3. **Consider retry strategy** with longer delays for overloaded API
4. **Track training metrics** to see if unfaithful reasoning emerges

## Technical Notes

- Generation used Claude 3.5 Haiku model
- Geometric distribution for fact selection working correctly
- Document regeneration logic successfully detected and handled short documents
- Event loop cleanup issues resolved with proper async client closing
